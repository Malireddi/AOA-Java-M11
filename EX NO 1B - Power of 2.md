## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

Example:

Enter number of elements: 4
Enter array elements:
1 2 2 1
Enter value of k: 1
Number of valid pairs with absolute difference 1: 4
