# EX 1E Integer Multiplication using Divide and Conquer Approach(Strassen’s algorithm).
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
You are given two square matrices A and B of size n × n (where n is a power of 2). Your task is to compute their matrix product using Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication algorithm and return the resulting matrix.

Unlike traditional matrix multiplication which takes O(n3)O(n^3)O(n3) time, Strassen’s algorithm improves this by reducing the number of recursive multiplications from 8 to 7, achieving approximately O(n2.81)O(n^{2.81})O(n2.81) complexity.
